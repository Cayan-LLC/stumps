stumps
======

Stumps is a HTTP proxy server that's useful when testing web services (eg: REST or SOAP services) as well as traditional browser-based applications. The SET group has been given ownership of the Stumps project with the goal of stumping out critical applications to make auto testing not reliant on third part software.  Our goal is to get it fully working inside Merchant Warehouse for automation testing and then provide it to the Open Source community.
